### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently learning Web-Development @WBS-Coding-School. 

For a long time I always came back to "programming" as kind of a hobby but never had any intentions to do it in terms of a professional career. 

But... the time has finally come and I am very happy and excited to start the journey.
It starts here ;)
